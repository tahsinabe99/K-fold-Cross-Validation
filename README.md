# K-fold-Cross-Validation
This repo contains code that checks how different value of 'k' in k-fold cross-validation effect the bias and variance of SVM,KNN, DT and LR algorithms. We have data sets of 3 sizes, large, medium and small, and for ach size I have used 4 datasets.

# To run the program
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/tahsinabe99/K-fold-Cross-Validation.git

2️⃣ Install Python and Required Libraries
pip install notebook pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

3️⃣ Install VS Code & Extensions
To install extensions:
Open VS Code.
Go to the Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on Mac).
Search for Python and Jupyter, then click Install.

4️⃣ Open & Run Jupyter Notebook
Go to folder of your choice example Large, Medium or small, then select the database your want to run
Open a .ipynb file inside VS Code.
A Run Cell button should appear on the top of each code cell.
If prompted, select a Python interpreter with Jupyter installed.
Click Run All or execute each cell one by one.
